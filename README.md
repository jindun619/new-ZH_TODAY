## 2) Why I made 振华TODAY
### 2.1 Convenience of students
`"I decided to develop a website when I saw that students were inconvenient not knowing the school meals"`
### 2.2 Improvement of the quality
![vicious cycle](img/vicious_cycle.png)
`->Because the quality of food is low, nobody comes to eat.`
`->Because nobody comes to eat, waste of food increases.`
`->Because waste of food increases, food is cooked with leftovers.`
`->Because food is cooked with leftovers, food loses its quality`
**`"After analyzing the cause of low quality of the school meals, I found out that the four things above(↑) form a vicious cycle. And I thought one way to break the cycle was to let students know the school meals in advance."`**
